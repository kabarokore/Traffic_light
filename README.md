This repository contains a set of state diagrams for a traffic light system in the fictional city of Gishushu. The diagrams were created using the PlantUML language and cover the following scenarios:

Basic Traffic Lights: The main state diagram showing the basic traffic light states and transitions.
Pedestrian Crossing Cancellation: Allows pedestrians to cancel the crossing if they decide not to cross, returning the lights to the normal traffic flow.
